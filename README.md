# Astronomy Kinesthetic Activity
## Abstract

## Motivation
- active/kinesthetic learning
- model-based learning
- Retrograde motion can be explained by two different models of solar system
  dynamics.

## Methods
- New Local Positioning System (LPS) devices
  - UWB radio
  - 3D positioning
  - Live recording
- Two students two walk in concentric circular paths representing two Solar
  System planets
- The data is recorded to a PC
  - Figure shows expected 2D locations of two "planets" in orbit
    around a common center in an arbitrary coordinate reference system
- After recording, data is transformed two ways
  - "Geocentric view" shows the displacement between one planet and the other
  - Another transform shows the phase of the displacement vector, which is
    analogous to the view of one plannet from the location of the other as
    seen against the background of the Celestial Sphere.

## Results
- Combines LPS and computational methods with model-based learning in a
  kinesthetic activity
- demonstrates Retrograde motion emerging from the Heliocentric model

## Future Work
- Live plots
- Could be expanded to directly compare Geocentric model
- Assessment of learning outcomes
